Lastly, please follow the code style and commit message guidelines when contributing to the project.

if you build anythin, please update the documentation in the docs directory, this will help other developers to understand how to use the new feature and also help us to maintain the project in the long run and also include what you've built in a new file and the file name should be the same as the feature name, this will help us to keep the documentation organized and easy to navigate. Lastly, please make sure to update the new file called "updates.md" with any new features or changes that you've made, this will help users to understand what the project is about and how to use it.
